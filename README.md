**Non-Fungible Tokens as a supply chain solution.**

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are digital assets that represent ownership of a unique item or concept. They are stored on a blockchain and can be bought, sold, and traded like any other asset.

One potential use case for NFTs within a supply chain is to track the ownership and movement of goods as they pass through various stages of production, distribution, and sale. For example, an NFT could be created for each batch of raw materials that enter a manufacturing facility, and then updated with information about where those materials were used and what products they were used to create. This could help companies track the origin and history of their products, and make it easier to trace them back to their source in the event of a recall or other issue.

NFTs could also be used to verify the authenticity of products, by linking them to a unique digital asset that represents the product's provenance. This could be particularly useful for high-value items such as luxury goods or art, where counterfeiting is a concern.

Overall, the use of NFTs in a supply chain could help companies improve transparency, traceability, and authenticity, which could in turn enhance customer trust and loyalty.
